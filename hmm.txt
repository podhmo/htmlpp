- using pyimport, calling function name is render_fmt prefixed name.(e.g. hello -> render_hello)
- function called by template, does not handle function arguments.
- get_locator,Locator naming is bad
- forgetting to put '<@yield/>', this maybe a cause of bug
- using prestring as internal StriongIO, then eval-once action can be defiend?
- refactoring, put pass if empty. (create subclass of prestring module)
- adjustment indentation and needless newline for output
- hole tag? (collecting js scripts at one place)
